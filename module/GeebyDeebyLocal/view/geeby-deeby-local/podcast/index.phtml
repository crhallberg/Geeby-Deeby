<h1>The Spare Change Library</h1>

<p>The Spare Change Library is the dime novel and popular literature podcast, featuring audio editions of stories, as well as scholarship. The podcast is broken into "substreams" based on the content. We currently have two of these substreams: Mittie's Storytime (fiction) and Professor M's Lecture Series (scholarship). These are all available through a shared <a href="<?=$this->url('podcast-rss')?>">RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>The Spare Change Library is produced by Lancelot Darling & Friends (named after the hero of Mrs. Alex. McVeigh Miller's <i>The Bride of the Tomb</i>). For glimpses of behind-the-scenes action, check out the <a href="http://lancelotdarling.wordpress.com/">production blog</a>.</p>
